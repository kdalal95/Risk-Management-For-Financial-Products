## Overview

This project aims at solvinf two problem statements.
• To evaluate the loan credit risk.
• To detect whether the insurance claim is fraudulent or not.

## Data Source Description

The data that I have used is Kaggle data.
The dataset consisted records of 82,000 customers with 16 attributes and 1000 customers with 39 attributes, respectively.

## Model Selection

To fit the data, the classification models that we wish to compare are Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gradiant Boosting Classifier. 
I have split the entire data frame into 80% Training Set and 20% Test set, where I hold out the Test Set for final model evaluation. 
Using the models with best score I have further deployed the app.
